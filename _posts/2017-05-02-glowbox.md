title: The Query Halo Effect
---

I read papers. A lot of them. Most of them conference papers. 
SIGIR, ACL, EMNLP, CIKM, WWW, WSDM, CHI, ... I try to at least browse through the
published abstracts every year. Some of those papers stick with me for a long time, because the idea 
is quirky, the approach is interesting or the results are surprising. One of those papers is
[Leading people to longer queries](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2481418) from CHI 2013. It asks
an intruiging question: *is it possible to entice people to write longer (Web search) queries by
altering the query box with a halo or glow as queries get longer?*

More to the point, does this halo around the search box:

motivate you to continue typing until the search box turns blue?

In the original paper, the answer was yes, but the approach was only tested in a *lab setting*,
with particularly complex topics drawn from [A Google a Day](http://www.agoogleaday.com/). Those
**search puzzles** are manually designed and require a number of searches to find the answer. 
The participants were [Mechanical Turk workers](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) who had to solve the following
three puzzles:

<img src="../img/question.png" width="15px"> *How many churches were built by the architect of the world's first triple-domed cathedral (and his office) after the Great Fire of London?*

<img src="../img/question.png" width="15px"> *What tree does a mammal with fingerprints (primates excluded) rely on for food?*

<img src="../img/question.png" width="15px"> *What material fuses with lime and soda to create an item on your dinner table that's considered to be an amorphous solid?*

I admire the creativity of whoever designed those puzzles, but it is clear that these topics are not what any
normal searcher is having in mind when searching. In the study all queries by the participants - some receiving the halo search box and some not - were logged and analyzed. Participants in the halo condition did indeed write significantly
longer queries. But ... this is a lab study ... on topics that are not very representative of the real world.

Together with [Djoerd Hiemstra](http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~hiemstra/) (who is also behind [Searsia](http://searsia.org/) which powers the [UTwente site search](https://search.utwente.nl/)) and [Leif Azzopardi](http://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/azzopardileifdr/) we asked ourselves: **can this finding of a "halo effect" be *reproduced* in a more natural Web setting?** Our answer to this question is published in our [SIGIR 2017](http://sigir.org/sigir2017) short paper:

```bibtex
@inproceedings{Hiemstra2017,
  author = {Djoerd Hiemstra and Claudia Hauff and Leif Azzopardi},
  booktitle = {SIGIR '17: 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval},
  title = {Exploring the Query Halo Effect in Site Search},
  pages = {...},
  year = {2017}
}
```

In particular, we implemented the halo effect in the site search of the University of Twente, a federated search engine based on 35 resources including Google's site search,
local courses, local news, the telephone directory as well as the university's social meedia feeds (Twitter, Flickr and Facebook).
We deployed versions of the halo in an A/B test setup across a 50-day period. Overall, in that period the most popular
queries (not query terms!) were the following: *minor*, *matlab*, *library*, *css* and *eduroam*. That may already give
you a hint at how this experiment turned out.

In one of our experiments we considered the most basic question:

**Does the query halo effect lead people to longer queries in a naturalistic setting?**

In January 2017, in the `no-halo` condition (users see the standard query box) 884 different users submitted 1,623 
queries to our site search engine. In the `halo` condition (users see the query box with a halo enabled),
803 users submitted 1,367 queries. Lets look at the results:

The results show that on average `no-halo` queries are 2.18 terms long (standard deviation of 1.36) while in the `halo` 
condition the average almost indistinguishable with 2.16. So no, in our natural Web search setting, we were not able to
reproduce this good-looking lab study.
