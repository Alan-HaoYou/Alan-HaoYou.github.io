title: Beyond the MOOC platform: where can we find traces of our MOOC learners?
---

In the past years, we have been heavily relying on social media for research purposes (like many other research groups)
and by now it is very clear that we can learn *a lot* about people (and events, locations, etc.) from the social media 
traces they leave behind across the Web.

Once we started looking at people that participate in MOOCs (i.e. the "learners") from a research perspective, we were
also curious to know where else on the Web they are active: on which social platforms do MOOC learners leave their
traces behind? The motivation for this question is not hard to find: 


TU Delft is a very active contributor of MOOCs on the [edX platform](https://www.edx.org/), 
which are regularly taken by tens of thousands of learners across the world. One of the most (de)pressing issues of
current MOOCs are the lack of retention and the lack of engagement we observe - most learners disengage within a few days
of having started the course (if they start it at all). A lot of research in recent years has heavily focused on those learners
that disengage, ignoring those learners (in the best possible sense) that actually make it.

Instead of ignoring the engaged learners, we made them the focus of our work, exploring to what extent they 
actuall *apply* the knowledge they gained in a MOOC in a practical setting, resulting in a paper at the Learning@Scale
conference this year.

The paper's abstract:

> Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have enabled millions of learners across the globe to 
> increase their levels of expertise in a wide variety of subjects. Research efforts surrounding 
> MOOCs are typically focused on improving the learning experience, as the current retention rates 
> (less than 7% of registered learners complete a MOOC) show a large gap between vision and reality 
> in MOOC learning.
> Current data-driven approaches to MOOC adaptations rely on data traces learners generate
> *within* a MOOC platform such as edX or Coursera. As a MOOC typically lasts between five and eight weeks 
> and with many MOOC learners being rather passive consumers of the learning material, this exclusive 
> use of MOOC platform data traces limits the insights that can be gained from them. 
>
> The Social Web potentially offers a rich source of data to *supplement* the MOOC platform data 
> traces, as many learners are also likely to be active on one or more Social Web platforms. 
> In this work, we present a first exploratory analysis of the Social Web platforms MOOC learners are 
> active on; we consider more than 320,000 learners that registered for 18 MOOCs on the edX platform and 
> explore their user profiles and activities on StackExchange, GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn.


In other words, the majority of learners (in this specific MOOC) are not employing the skills they have acquired
in any meaningful way. This may not be too surprising, considering the complexity of functional languages and the upstart issues
developers face when they first make the move towards functional languages. However, it raises some questions regarding the 
purpose of MOOCs - if learners never apply what they have learnt, they will quickly unlearn it. 

I want to show "off" two observations we made. In this first exploration, we considered only the most basic coding 
metric - the number of lines of code added in a particular language by our learners across any of their publicly 
available Github projects. If the engaged learners we identified on GitHub are truly working through the MOOC, their GitHub projects
should reflect this. The FP101x MOOC teaches Haskell exclusively, and so we plotted the number of lines of Haskell code added by our 
learners across time:

FP101x was taught in the red period. It is a sensible result: more Haskell code is written during the course by our learners. Most interesting
though is what happens after the end of the course - Haskell enters a steady decline, it only takes a few months before pre-MOOC
Haskell programming levels are reached.

What is going on? We know that some learners did indeed transfer. 
However, those learners that stick with functional programming simply move on to other languages. Lets take a look at the
code lines added over time across a range of functional languages. In this plot, we only considered the subset of learners that had
never functionally programmed before FP101x and began programming functionally afterwards (i.e. we can be quite certain that the 
MOOC impacted their knowledge and skills):

Haskell is starting out strong during the MOOC (October 2014 to December 2014), but quickly declines and is replaced by Scala and surprisingly
Racket to some extent.
