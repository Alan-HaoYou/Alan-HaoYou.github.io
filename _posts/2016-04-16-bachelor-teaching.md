title: Reflections on teaching a large Bachelor course
---

Together with one of my colleagues (Alessandro Bozzon), I teach a Bachelor course 
called *Web and Database Technology* within the Technical Computer Science degree program at TU Delft.
The course is not only compulsory for our first year Computer Science students, but also for all those
students choosing Software Design & Application as their minor. 

This means that we usually have to deal with more than 300 students (the most recent edition had 320)
in the classroom - some of whom had never written a line of HTML before, others had 2-3 years of 
JavaScript programming experience already.

The course has a standard structure: two lectures (90 minutes each) and one 4-hour lab session per week for 
eight weeks. The midterm and final exam each account for 40% of the grade, the lab project is worth the
remaining 20%. I teach the *Web technology* part (8 of the 15 lectures) and will discuss that one for the 
rest of the blog post.

One aspect of large classes I continously battle with is how exactly to *engage* such a large number
of students. Nothing is worse than 300 bored students looking down at you (or more
likely at their laptops) bored or completely lost 20 minutes into a 90 minute lectures. In the last two years 
I mostly relied on [FeedbackFruits](https://secure.feedbackfruits.com/) (a Web platform that turns
any browser-enabled device into a clicker) to test the students' level of understanding through
**multiple-choice questions**. My questions tend to look like this:

or this:

Unfortunately, I don't learn very much from the students' answers:

All I know is that 9% of the students got it right - I have no idea  *why* the rest of the class failed to answer
the question correctly.
