title: Reflections on teaching a large Bachelor course
---

Together with one of my colleagues (Alessandro Bozzon), I teach a Bachelor course 
called *Web and Database Technology* within the Technical Computer Science degree program at TU Delft.
The course is not only compulsory for our first year Computer Science students, but also for all those
students choosing Software Design & Application as their minor. 

This means that we usually have to deal with more than 300 students (the most recent edition had 320)
in the classroom - some of whom had never written a line of HTML before, others had 2-3 years of 
JavaScript programming experience already.

The course has a standard structure: two lectures (90 minutes each) and one 4-hour lab session per week for 
eight weeks. The midterm and final exam each account for 40% of the grade, the lab project is worth the
remaining 20%. I teach the *Web technology* part (8 of the 15 lectures).

## The problem
One aspect of large classes I continously battle with is how exactly to *engage* such a large number
of students. Nothing is worse than 300 students looking down at you (or more
likely at their laptops and smartphones) bored or completely lost 20 minutes into a 90 minute lectures. 
In the last two years I mostly relied on [FeedbackFruits](https://secure.feedbackfruits.com/) 
(a Web platform that turns any browser-enabled device into a clicker) to test the students' level 
of understanding through **multiple-choice questions**. My questions tend to look like this:

or this:

Unfortunately, I don't learn very much from the students' answers:

All I know is that 9% of the students got it right - I have no idea  **why** the rest of the class failed to answer
the question correctly. I either have the choice to take a stab in the dark and explain some of the material one 
more time or I move on to the next topic. Both options are unsatisfactory for the students and myself.

In this year's edition of the course we<sup>1</sup> addressed this issue in two ways:
+ We provided screencasts of almost all lectures: instead of simply recording ourselves during the lectures, we
created between 3 and 6 video segments per lecture. Students that were not able to follow the course should be 
able to catch up by watching the screencasts.
+ We replaced FeedbackFruits with [ASQ](http://asq.inf.usi.ch/), which provides a much richer set of question types
and a much richer set of realtime feedback, enabling *data analytics in the classroom* (who wouldn't want that!)

So, how did we fare?
