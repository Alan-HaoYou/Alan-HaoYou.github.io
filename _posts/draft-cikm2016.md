title: CIKM 2016
---

This blog post is the second in (a hopefully a long) series of posts that take a look at recent conference proceedings
and my favourite papers among them. I am a happy proceedings addict: I tend to read through all major proceedings of information
retrieval conferences and recently have also taken an interest in NLP/CV (read: deep learning) conferences - well, who hasn't? 

Here, I am going over the CIKM proceedings - the conference is currently ongoing with all papers already up on [ACM Portal](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2983323).
