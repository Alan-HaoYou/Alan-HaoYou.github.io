[SIGIR 2017](http://sigir.org/sigir2017/), the *40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval* took place in early August and was the largest ever with more than 900 researchers gathering in Tokyo, Japan. It was also the largest ever in terms of [awards](http://sigir.org/sigir2017/program/awards/) being handed out. The proceedings are currently freely available on the [ACM Portal](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3077136); 362 papers were submitted (well short of the 2011 record number of submissions: 543) and 78 of those were accepted (22% acceptance rate).

Works on user interactions, conversational search and neural methods for IR were on the rise; evaluation & recommender systems' papers were a stable presence; social and entity papers were in decline (not many mentions of Twitter overall). Mark Sanderson did some wordcloud magic on the SIGIR (short) paper titles:

Among the long papers, I found the following the most interesting:

* Tetsuya Sakai is on a mission to ensure that IR researchers get their statistics in order, in particular their significance tests and how to interpret their outcomes. In (The Probability that Your Hypothesis Is Correct, Credible Intervals, and Effect Sizes for IR Evaluation)[https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080766], Sakai proposes the use of Bayesian statistics to get what we really want from our statistical tests: a probability that the hypothesis we pose is true, given the data. A good brush-up on statistical tests, their purpose and their limitations.
