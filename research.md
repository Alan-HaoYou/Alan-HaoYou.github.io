        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Strict Black-and-white Conversion Methods for Gray-Scale Elements in Topology Optimization of Heat Conduction Structures</h3>
        LAB OF REFRIGRATION AND CRYOGENICS http://www.sjtuirc.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx
        <p>Abstract:<br>
        Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP)  topology optimization is a kind of structure optimization method. During the SIMP topology optimization, gray-scale elements exist, which bring uncertainties in de-scribing the boundary of topology optimized structures.And this problem is more serious in heat conduction structure topology optimization, because heat conduction topology optimized structure has many tree-like branches structures. When compared with beam topology optimized structure’s boundaries, heat conduction structure’s boundaries are more complex.To eliminate gray-scale elements in topology optimization, original topology optimization results are changed into strict discrete or black-and-white topology optimization results. We propose three new strict black-and-white conversion methods, Local Penalized Method, Suc-cessive Conversion Method and Automata Conversion Method, to eliminate gray-scale elements. Two typical numerical examples, which are the heat conduction topology optimization and the half MBB-beam optimization respectively, are used to illustrate the availability of the methods to elimi-nate gray-scale elements.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">2D Design of Channels in Vapor Chamber with Topological Optimization</h3>
        LAB OF REFRIGRATION AND CRYOGENICS http://www.sjtuirc.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx
        <p>Abstract:<br>
        In this paper, the topology optimization method is conducted to aid the design of the fluid channels within a vapor chamber. To analyze the temperature uniformity of a vapor chamber, the channels were simplified as branches with high-conductivity materials, the optimization aimed to minimize the temperature variance in a plate with several high-conductivity branches. Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the influence of material thermal conductivity ratio and Bi number on the topology of the fluid channel structure. Results showed that the design of topology optimization was feasible and effective.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Automata Topology Optimization Method for SIMP Gray-Scale Elements</h3>
        LAB OF REFRIGRATION AND CRYOGENICS http://www.sjtuirc.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx
        <p>Abstract:<br>
        Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) topology optimization method is one of the structure topology optimization methods, which could be used for structure optimization on heat conduction and convective heat transfer with a certain structure material. However, some gray-scale elements exist in the results, which could make the solid boundaries unclear and bring uncertainty in subsequent simulation and manufacture. The tradi-tional threshold filtering method could be used to obtain strict blank-and-white optimization results, but it is al-ways coupled with the structure volume varying in topology optimization. In this paper, the SIMP with automata topology optimization method is conducted which introduces mutual interaction between two gray-scale ele-ments. Therefore, the pseudo density could be transmitted among elements and converge near the high pseudo density elements, the gray-scale elements could be eliminated, and the material volume could keep a constant. </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Topology Optimization of Natural Convective Rectangular Fins</h3>
        LAB OF REFRIGRATION AND CRYOGENICS http://www.sjtuirc.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx
        <p>Abstract:<br>
        This paper focuses on topology optimization for natural convective heat transfer structures. A predisposed topology optimization for 2D fins structure based on rectangular fins is proposed for natural convection heat transfer enhancement. The entransy dissipation of the topological fin is less than that of the traditional fin. With simulations on FloTHERM, the average temperature and the highest temperature of the base plate are improved comparing to the case with the rectangular fin, therefore, topology optimal fin is effective for heat dissipation extended surface.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Non-linear deflection of a circular diaphragm-type piezoactuator under loads of voltage and pressure</h3>
        LAB OF REFRIGRATION AND CRYOGENICS http://www.sjtuirc.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx
        <p>Abstract:<br>
        Analytical non-linear equations are formulated to predict the deflection of a circular diaphragm-type piezoactuator, which consists of a passive layer, a bonding layer and a PZT layer. Previous similar analytical solutions presented in the literature are based on thin plates with small deflections (linear problem), however the linear solutions fail to predict the deflection of the piezoactuator when the driven loads, such as voltage and pressure loads, are large. In this research, a non-linear analytical solution for the piezoactuator deflection under loads of voltage and pressure is derived using the principal of minimum energy and the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Each of the three layers in the piezoactuator is considered as an individual layer. The energy associated with the solution includes elastic potential energy of the deformed piezoactuator, electric potential energy in the piezodisc, and the work done by the uniform pressure force. The proposed non-liner solution is validated via static deflection measurements, and it approves that the non-linear analytical results are found to be in a good agreement with the measurements while the linear solution is invalid when the loads are large. Based on the non-linear equations, the effects of the piezoactuator dimensions and the imposed loads on the actuator performance (stroke volume) are also investigated.</p>

        <p>Abstract:<br>
         To cast light on the reasons of soot reduction, non- evaporative and evaporative spray behaviors of diesel and emulsified fules were investigated in a high temperature high pressure constant volume vessel (HTHP-CVV). Schilrien photography system was established to study the macro spray characteristics, such as liquid penetration and cone angle, both at room and high temperature. Besides, chemiluminescence of diesel and emulsion falme was recorded by high-speed camera.</p>
