        <h3>Strict Black-and-white Conversion Methods for Gray-Scale Elements in Topology Optimization of Heat Conduction Structures</h3>
Abstract:
Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP)  topology optimization is a kind of structure optimization method. During the SIMP topology optimization, gray-scale elements exist, which bring uncertainties in de-scribing the boundary of topology optimized structures.And this problem is more serious in heat conduction structure topology optimization, because heat conduction topology optimized structure has many tree-like branches structures. When compared with beam topology optimized structure’s boundaries, heat conduction structure’s boundaries are more complex.To eliminate gray-scale elements in topology optimization, original topology optimization results are changed into strict discrete or black-and-white topology optimization results. We propose three new strict black-and-white conversion methods, Local Penalized Method, Suc-cessive Conversion Method and Automata Conversion Method, to eliminate gray-scale elements. Two typical numerical examples, which are the heat conduction topology optimization and the half MBB-beam optimization respectively, are used to illustrate the availability of the methods to elimi-nate gray-scale elements.
