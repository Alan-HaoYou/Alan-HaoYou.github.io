## MSc thesis supervision

I am supervising students who conduct research in *information retrieval* and *learning analytics*; combinations of the two areas ("search as learning") are especially interesting to me. For in information retrieval, ongoing benchmark competitions give you a good idea of hot-topic tasks and research directions: 

- [MediaEval](http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2017/)
- [SemEval](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/)
- [CLEF](http://clef2017.clef-initiative.eu/index.php?page=Pages/labs_info.php)
- [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov/)
- [NTCIR](http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html)

If you are interested in learning analytics, have a look at the proceedings of the [first](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556325) and [second edition](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2724660) 
of the ACM Learning At Scale conference - they contain many interesting contributions in the area of massive open online learning.
 
## Courses
 
 Below are the resources I have developed for my courses (some are more up-to-date than others): 
 *Big Data Processing*, *Web and Database Technology* and *Information Retrieval*.

### Big Data Processing

Since 2013/2014 I have been teaching the second year Bachelor course *Big Data Processing* at TU Delft (with 2016/17 being the last time for now). The course covers a range of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem after a short excursion into the streaming world; 
I created the material based on a number of great books, including [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/),
[Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/), 
[Hadoop: The Definite Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033448.do), [Programming Pig](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001811/index.html)
and [ZooKeeper](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028901.do).

### Web (and Database) Technology
Since 2013/2014 I have also been teaching the first year Bachelor course *Web and Database Technology* at TU Delft, together with
[Alessandro Bozzon](http://alessandrobozzon.com/). I teach the Web technology part, which turned out to be quite a challenge due to
the wide variety of skill sets our incoming students possess (some work as Web developers, others have never written a single line of HTML
before the start of this course). To level the playing field for the more than 300 students we have every year, we rely on the [Learning Web App Development](http://learningwebappdev.com/)
book, which introduces the modern Web stack in an accessible and practical manner. The lectures build on the material introduced
in the book.

### Information Retrieval

#### Slides - 2017/18 Edition
After a few years of not teaching IR, I am back at it. This time, the *Information Retrieval* course covers core IR topics for half of the lectures and NLP topics (taught by Nava Tintarev) for the other half.

- [More query refinement and interactive IR](../documents/ir2017/Interactive-IR-Lecture.pdf)
- Personalization

- Learning to rank


#### Slides - 2011/12 Edition
In 2011/12 I taught my core area of research in a Master course *Information Retrieval* at TU Delft. This course was my first excursion
into the use of Hadoop & Co as part of my teaching, thanks to a grant from Amazon and their (at the time) "AWS Education" scheme - $3500
to allow students to use a real Hadoop cluster for their experiments.  

The course material is quite old by now, but it may still be useful to some. It was also my first venture into the 
teaching of large classes, the structure and design of the course certainly reflects that.
