## News

- Our analysis of learning transfer among programmers taking a MOOC has been accepted at [ACM L@S](http://learningatscale.acm.org/las2016/): 
do learner actually apply what they have learned in practice? Take a look at [my blog]({% post_url 2016-03-01-learning-transfer %}).
- We are getting the word out about our MOOC-related learning analytics work; a demonstration paper 
about one of my Master student's work on self-regulation and learner feedback has been accepted at 
the Learning Analytics for Learners workshop, co-located with LAK 2016.

## About me

Since 2013, I work as an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/). Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with three PhD students 
I am supervising (Guanliang Chen, Yue Zhao and Dan Davis), I am currently focusing heavily on large-scale learning analytics 
and how to incorporate search into the learning process at scale. TU Delft is a very active provider of 
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground; 
ultimately, I (and the whole [WIS Learning Analytics team](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/learning-analytics/) 
aim to provide insights and develop mechanisms to improve learning at scale.

My research vision for the coming years focuses on two projects (MoSeS and BoOLE), connected through the MOOC use case.
