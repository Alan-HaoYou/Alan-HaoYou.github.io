## News

- Our learning analytics research is taking off with **five** recent full paper acceptances at [ACM UMAP 2016](http://www.um.org/umap2016/), [ACM WebScience 2016](http://websci16.org/), [EDM 2016](http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2016/) and 2x [ECTEL 2016](http://www.ec-tel.eu/index.php?id=732).
- At [ACM SIGIR 2016](http://sigir.org/sigir2016/) I will be co-organizing a workshop on **Search as Learning** together with Jacek Gwizdka, Preben Hansen, Jiyin He and Noriko Kando. [Our workshop website is online](http://chauff.github.io/sal2016/).
- Our analysis of learning transfer among programmers taking a MOOC has been accepted at [ACM L@S](http://learningatscale.acm.org/las2016/): 
do learner actually apply what they have learned in practice? Take a look at [my blog]({% post_url 2016-03-01-learning-transfer %}).

## About me

Since 2013, I work as an Assistant Professor (tenured as of 01/2016) at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/). Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with three PhD students 
I am supervising (Guanliang Chen, Yue Zhao and Dan Davis), I am currently focusing heavily on large-scale learning analytics and how to incorporate search into the learning process at scale (after all, I am an *IR* researcher!). TU Delft is a very active provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground; ultimately, I and the whole [WIS Learning Analytics team](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/learning-analytics/) I lead, aim to provide insights and develop mechanisms to improve learning at scale. 

To get some track record in the domain of learning (and to sell my interest of search as learning), together with my PhD students I have made a concerted effort to enter the community through publications. In the past 12 months, this strategy has led to **six** full papers at top-level conferences. To get a quick overview of the kind of questions we have published about, take a look at the slides, they cover each contribution in 1-2 slides:
