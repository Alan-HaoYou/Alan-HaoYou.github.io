## News

- I attended ICLR 2017 and [Wrote a blog post about it](http://chauff.github.io/2017-04-25-iclr2017/).
- I have been **awarded** an [**NWO Top Grant**](http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/ew/63-miljoen-top-subsidie-voor-18-exacte-topwetenschappers.html) to conduct "innovative or high-risk scientific research that addresses questions of high quality and urgency;" [I will push the boundaries of large-scale collaborative search](http://chauff.github.io/2016-11-27-lacrosse/)! The grant funds a 4-year PhD position, starting in May 2017.

## Briefly

Since 2013, I have been working as Assistant Professor (tenured as of 01/2016) at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/). Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with three PhD students 
I am supervising (Guanliang Chen, Yue Zhao and Dan Davis), I am currently focusing on large-scale learning analytics and how to incorporate search into the learning process at scale (after all, I am an *IR* researcher!). TU Delft is a very active provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground; ultimately, I and the whole [WIS Learning Analytics team](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/learning-analytics/) I lead, aim to provide insights and develop mechanisms to improve learning at scale. To get a quick overview of the kind of questions we have recently published about, take a look at the following slides, they cover each contribution in 1-2 slides (check the speaker notes as well):
