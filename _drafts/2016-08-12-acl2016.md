title: ACL 2016

In this post, I am collecting the most interesting papers I came across when attending
the [2016 Association for Computational Linguistics conference](http://acl2016.org/). 
Nowadays, a lot of computational linguistics is *deep* and correspondingly
there is a lot of interest from industry to hear what is going on and find new employees. 
This interest was reflected in the number of participants: more than 1600 people had signed
up. A large number of submissions also meant a large number of accepted papers and subsequently
we ended up with a program that had up to SEVEN parallel sessions.
Overall, 231 long papers were accepted as well as 97 short papers and 28 system demonstrations. 

The proceedings are [available online](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/). Be prepared to spend
a week browsing through them.

The papers I list here are those that I personally found most insightful.
